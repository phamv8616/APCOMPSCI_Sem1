Notes 01

-Set up file by creating a text file on the desktop
-Rename the file so it ends in “.java”
 -ex: firstProg.java
-Drag that file into notepad++
-Type out:

public class -insert the file name here- (Has to be typed out exactly as it’s named)
{
	public static void main(String[]args)
	{
		System.out.println(“Hello World”);
	}
}

-Remember to save after you’re done






COMPILE:

-Need to compile it into byte code that java can interpret 

Plugins->Plugin manager->Show Plugin Manager

-will say “Downloading plugin list…”
- scroll down and select NPPExec->Install->(pop-up)Yes->(pop-up)Yes

Plugins->NppExec->Execute

Underneath Commands, write:
//save the file
NPP_SAVE

//change to the current directory
cd "$(CURRENT_DIRECTORY)"

//tell notepad++ where java is
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_05\bin\javac $(FILE_NAME)

Click save->Script name: JAVACOMPILE->save->okay

-class file will appear on the desktop







EXECUTE:

Plugins->NppExec->Execute->temporary script

Underneath commands, write:
//save the file
NPP_SAVE

//change to the current directory
cd "$(CURRENT_DIRECTORY)"

//tell notepad++ where java is
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_05\bin\java $(FILE_NAME)

-name it and save it as JAVAEXECUTE

-if you want quotes to appear in what’s printed out… put a backslash in front of it

-ex: System.out.print.ln(“  \”\”  \”\” “);

-Hit f6 to compile and execute for it to print out





ESCAPE KEYS:

Certain characters have specific function that they carry out. They can often be problematic when typing code.
These problem characters include:

	<
	>
	"
	'
	\
	&

To fix this, you put a backslash in front:

\t	Inserts a tab in the text at this point.
\b	Inserts a backspace in the text at this point.
\n	Inserts a newline in the text at this point.
\r	Inserts a carriage return in the text at this point.
\f	Inserts a form feed in the text at this point.
\'	Inserts a single quote character in the text at this point.
\"	Inserts a double quote character in the text at this point.
\\	Inserts a backslash character in the text at this point.





ASII Art:


It is a graphic design that is created by compiling characters to make text art


An example would be:


X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X

You can enter each row of the ASCII art in the

System.out.prinln(" insert here ");
System.out.prinln(" insert here ");
System.out.prinln(" insert here ");
System.out.prinln(" insert here ");
System.out.prinln(" insert here ");
